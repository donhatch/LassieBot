Build recipes known to work:

  * On Linux:

    * In Android Studio:
      * Build -> Build APK

    * Command line:

      The gradlew script in the repo won't work out of the box--
      it gives the following error:
        > SDK location not found. Define location with sdk.dir in the
        local.properties file or with an ANDROID_HOME environment variable.

      You gotta do what it says.  The simplest way is to open
      the project in Android Studio (no need to build it there),
      which will create an appropriate local.properties file.
      Or, you can try to create local.properties yourself-- the contents should
      describe a location that exists, something like this if you've run
      Android Studio some time in the past on Linux:

        > `sdk.dir=/home/joe/Android/Sdk`

      or, on Windows, maybe something like this:

        > `sdk.dir=C\:\\Users\\Joe Blow\\AppData\\Local\\Android\\Sdk`

      If you get that right, commands like the following should work:
        * `./gradlew assembleDebug`
        * `./gradlew installDebug`
